- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jimspruell-gm
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... getting a full version of Linux on my Comet Lake Chrombook I would not care if I only had 
- full version of Linux and not Crome OS I have been developing embedded computer 
- systems since the late 1960's starting with several years of assemble language programming and 
- designing hardware to interface many computers as dedicated controllers. The most complex control 
- systems I have worked on were flight simulation systems for the F22 and F35 aircraft. I am now 
- developing home and building automation systems, programming mostly in python on Raspberry Pi,ESP8266 and ESP32 processors.
 I am starting to look into Docker to build apps that will hopefully run on many systems including Android and cloud based systems.
